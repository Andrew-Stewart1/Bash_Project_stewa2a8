# Bash_Project_stewa2a8
Password Generator written in Bash for the Bash Project IT3038C

# What is the purpose
The purpose of the script is to have a quick customizable password generator that is not connected to any services so it is more secure than any service connected to the internet. This allows for extra security when creating passwords and allows for 1 script to run rather than needing an account online (which is another password). 

# What problem does it solve

My main use for this script is to stop a bad behavoir that I personally practice but I know many do as well. Since applying for co-ops and other jobs I have had to create so many passwords that I start overlapping them across services, which is bad practice and is a security risk for many reasons. Since applying for a part time job I had to create 2 new passwords just to apply and accept the job, I got lazy and used the auto google ones because I did not want to use my personal ones. This script allows me to create and store passwords quickly without relying on google or another service to create and store them.


# Getting Started

Simply have the script run and input the desired values, it will create the text file on it's own. 

# How to Use

- Start the script with ./Pass_gen.sh
- It will then prompt for inputs, provide a number between 1-5 and then any number you desire
- It will output these to the terminal and a text file

# Help Function

The help function must be used as the first input in the script (When tested other ways an error is produced.)
-h: will display the usage of the command and give an example for how to generate a password.
