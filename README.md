Password Generator written in Bash for the Bash Project IT3038C

The purpose of the script is to have a quick customizable password generator that is not connected to any services so it is more secure than any service connected to the internet. This allows for extra security when creating passwords and allows for 1 script to run rather than needing an account online (which is another password). 

My main purpose for this script is to stop a bad behavoir that I personally practice but I know many do as well. Since applying for co-ops and other jobs I have had to create so many passwords that I start overlapping them across services, which is bad practice and is a security risk for many reasons. Since applying for a part time job I had to create 2 new passwords just to apply and accept the job, I got lazy and used the auto google ones because I did not want to use my personal ones. This script allows me to create and store passwords quickly without relying on google or another service to create and store them.
